Welcome to the ReNEWACT Laboratory led by Dr. Olusegun Abass
Home
Description
We are an environmental research laboratory focusing on the development and design of environmental materials and reactor operations dedicated to climate friendly and sustainable technologies. The latter guarantees efficient configuration and process optimization while minimizing environmental and climate impact by repurposing waste-streams and reducing energy consumption.
Motivation
We believe that excellence in science is a product of teamwork, thus, we partner with academia and industry to create collaborative and community impact innovations driven by social, economic and technological need. We are devoted to the mentorship of the next generation of engineers and scientists. We are committed to creating an enabling environment for all-inclusive human and environmental health and well-being. 
Research Strategy
With the current myriads of environmental challenges, our societies requires the tools and data to shift from a linear approach to resource management to a more multi-disciplinary, sustainable and circular approach.
Dr. Abass and his team at the ReNEWACT Laboratory, Landmark University carries out research at the Water-Energy-Climate Nexus to revolutionize how society views and utilize scarce resources by developing novel processes and tools for resource recovery and decarbonization. Our work spans areas such wastewater treatment and reuse, CO2 photocatalysis, water supply, purification and desalination, agro-based nutrient and waste recovery, remediation and pollution control, and climate change mitigation technologies. More specifically, we engage in the design of sustainable systems using environmental data analytics and tools to identify, quantify, and manage ubiquitous environmental pollutants (e.g. PAHs, PFAS), and GHG emissions in our urban water and nutrient cycles. This includes the development of advanced bio/nano-materials, bioprocesses, and machine learning tools to improve environmental resource management and ensure climate resilience.
